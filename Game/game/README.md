#StickHero game

##Description

Stretch the stick in order to reach and walk on the wooden platforms. Watch out! If the stick is not long enough, you will fall down!
How far can you go?

Game is played with the mouse. When you click, the stick will stretch until you release the mouse. After that the stick will fall on the other wood stock and the little guy will try to pass on the other side. If stick is short or it is longer than other wood stock's width little guy falls in water an the game ends. If stick falls on the other wood stock center it is a perfect move and you got an extra point. Main goal in game is to pass as more wood stocks as you can and collect as many points as you can.

Good Luck!
